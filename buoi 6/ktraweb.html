                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Levi Akerman</h1>
                <p style="text-align: center; width: 500px;">Levi has short, straight black hair styled in an undercut,
                     as well as narrow, intimidating dull gray eyes with dark
                    circles under them and a deceptively youthful face.
                    He is quite short, but his physique is well-developed in
                    musculature from extensive vertical maneuvering equipment
                    usage. He is usually either frowning or expressionless;
                    that, plus his extremely calm demeanor, often makes it 
                    difficult for others to guess what he is thinking. He is
                     most often seen in his Survey Corps uniform, with a light 
                     gray button up shirt underneath along with his trademark
                    white ascot. When embarking on expeditions outside the Walls,
                    he also wears the Survey Corps' green hooded cloak. Once, 
                    when forced to take leave from his duties due to injury, Levi
                    was seen in a black suit, plain white shirt, ascot, and dress 
                    shoes.[citation needed] However, since the beginning of the 
                    coup d'état, he has left the ascot off. For most of the time 
                    during which the Survey Corps were on the run from the military
                     and monarchy, he simply wore his vertical maneuvering equipment
                      harness over casual clothes.[citation needed]
